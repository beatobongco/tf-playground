# tf-playground

Things I learned while trying to grok tensorflow.

## Getting started

Using anaconda 3.6.x, install CPU version of tensorflow.

```
conda create -n tensorflow
source activate tensorflow
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.2.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
```
